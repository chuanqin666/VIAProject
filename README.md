# pythonProject
## DESCRIPTION
    
* A question is how to build an HTML/CSS layout for some region of interest. The farthest ancestor was a screenshot (an image). The screenshot was processed in various ways, and just before the current step (the HTML/CSS assembling), a set of the containers and elements was obtained with all the supporting information related.

## ENVIRONMENT

Larger rectangle has a webpage (or a web block) meaning, and smaller means a div container.
